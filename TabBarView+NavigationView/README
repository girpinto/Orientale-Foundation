# Tab Bars 
> A tab bar appears at the bottom of an app screen and lets people quickly switch among different sections of an app. 
> Tab bars are translucent, may have a background tint, maintain the same height in all screen orientations, and are hidden when a keyboard is displayed. 
> A tab bar may contain any number of tabs, but the number of visible tabs varies based on the device size and orientation. 
> If some tabs canâ€™t be displayed due to limited horizontal space, the final visible tab becomes a More tab, which reveals the additional tabs in a list 
> on a separate screen.

Ok let's begin the journey about **Tab Bars**. As you can read from **HIGS (Human Interface Guidelines)** by **Apple**, a Tab Bar is a way to organize your
application/software. With Tab Bar you will have the possibility to separate views. But why you should divide views in your application. Well, the answer is very
easy. 

Because they don't have the same purpose. In fact in your application you'll have views that allow your user to do something very specific and views that help him
just to store informations or maybe you'll have some views that are about a topic that is basically useless to link to other views. 

Tab Bars' power is just this : *separate views that are about different topic/purposes*. But let's make an example. 

# Example
Below are just showed some applications that you use every day, I'm not the owner of this applications (obviously ðŸ™„). The intent is just to show to anyone who
read this file what are Tab Bars and why they're so powerful.
